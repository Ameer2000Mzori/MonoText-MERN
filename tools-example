Color Scheme
Background: Soft White (#FAFAFA) for a clean, light background that doesn't strain the eyes.
Text: Dark Gray (#333333) for strong contrast and readability.
Accent Colors:
Sage Green (#97A897) for buttons, links, and highlights, offering a touch of warmth and sophistication.

Fonts
For a balance between readability and aesthetic appeal, I recommend the following font pairing:

Headings: Helvetica Neue, Arial, or a similar sans-serif font. These fonts are clean and modern, making them suitable for titles and headings.
Body Text: Merriweather, Georgia, or a serif font with high readability for the main article and body text. These fonts offer a classic look that complements the clean design of the e-magazine.
